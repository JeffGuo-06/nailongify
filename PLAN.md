# Nailongify - Project Plan

## Project Overview

**Nailongify** is a real-time web application that captures your facial expression via webcam and matches it to the most similar Nailong meme from a library of 10 meme images using facial landmark detection. Named after the beloved cartoon character Nailong.

---

## Technical Approach

### Core Technology Stack

- **React 18+** - Frontend framework
- **face-api.js** - Facial landmark detection and expression recognition
- **Vercel** - Deployment platform
- **Plain CSS** - Styling
- **Webcam API** - Browser camera access

### Matching Algorithm

**Option Selected:** Facial Landmark Matching

- Extract key facial landmarks (eyebrows, eyes, mouth, nose)
- Normalize landmarks (center and scale to unit variance)
- Calculate Euclidean distance between user and Nailong meme landmarks
- Return meme with minimum distance (highest similarity)

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup

**Goal:** Initialize React app and development environment

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Create React app with Vite or Create React App:
  ```bash
  npm create vite@latest nailongify -- --template react

  npm install
  ```
- [ ] Install dependencies:
  ```bash
  npm install face-api.js
  ```

  - Neutral/poker face Nailong
  - Other unique Nailong expression
- [ ] Optimize images for web (compress to <500KB each)
- [ ] Name files descriptively (e.g., `nailong-shocked.jpg`)

  ```json
  {
    "memes": [
      {
        "id": "shocked",
        "path": "/nailong/nailong-shocked.jpg",
        "name": "Shocked Nailong"
      },
      {
        "id": "happy",
        "path": "/nailong/nailong-happy.jpg",
        "name": "Happy Nailong"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

**Requirements:**

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Camera not accessible:**

- Check browser permissions (chrome://settings/content/camera)
- Ensure HTTPS connection (required for camera API)
- Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
- Check if another app is using camera

**face-api.js models not loading:**

- Verify model files are in `public/models/`
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Ensure correct file paths in code
- Models must be served over HTTP/HTTPS

**Poor matching accuracy:**

- Improve lighting on user's face
- Ensure Nailong meme images are clear
- Adjust similarity threshold
- Stay 1-2 feet from camera
- Face camera directly (not at angle)

**Slow performance:**

- Reduce detection frequency
- Lower video resolution
- Use TinyFaceDetector (faster)
- Disable debug visualization
- Test on desktop first

**Vercel deployment issues:**

- Check build logs for errors
- Verify all assets are in `public/`
- Ensure models are included in build
- Check vercel.json configuration
